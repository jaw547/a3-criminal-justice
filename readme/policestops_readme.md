# Police stops data

For the visualization on police stops regarding Marijuana violations in Colorado,
we used data from the Stanford Open Policing Project (https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:py883nd2578/CO-clean.csv.gz). 

## Objective
Answer the questions: 
* Did the police continue stopping people regarding marijuana violations in Colorado during the period 
before legalization and after referendum? 
* If so, who did they stop?

The main aim of this study is to explore whether police stops operate under racial biases 
during a period during which there are no incentives to prosecute marijuana violations. 
As such, we believe the time frame between referendum and legalization serve as a propitious 
natural experiment to observe trends of this sort. 

# To clean the data, I followed the next steps:

## CSV
* I downloaded the data into a CSV format.

## STATA
* Imported the data into STATA and transformed into a DTA file. This was due to Excel and R 
not having the capacity to download and view the total number of observations which exceed one million. 
* Using STATA, I filtered the number of observations by selecting only those police stops that were
related to marijuana violations using the violation_raw variable which categorized them as "Other".
* I then created a new date variable that kept month and year only. I did this by separating month, year, 
and day into different variables and concatenating month and year.
* I collapsed the number of observations using the month - year variable by race and gender. The end result
were 7 columns that indicate the total number of male, female, black, asian, hispanic, and white 
detainees by month and year in Colorado.

## Excel
* Exported data to new CSV file and opened it in excel. 
* Consequently, I regrouped the data into three columns as to make it compatible with the 
D3 visualization I selecte. These variables are key, value, and date; and they indicated identity attribute 
(white, male, female, black, asian, or hispanic), number of police stops, and month - year.
* Using the Java Script file I altered date variable specifications to make it compatible with the js date formats.
